<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>As you can see on my resume, I graduated from Ithaca College with a degree in Television & Radio production, before attending the University of Denver where I completed my Masters and began pursuing my career in mental health.
    <br /> 
    <br />
    Outside of work I have a diverse array of interests. I enjoy reading on a variety of subjects, including history, politics, philosophy, psychology (of course), and literature. My favorite sport is baseball, and I enjoy writing about baseball as well. I also took up running in graduate school and completed the New York Marathon in 2017. Here are a few pictures of my dogs, Tucker and Auri. Because who doesn't like dogs?</p>
